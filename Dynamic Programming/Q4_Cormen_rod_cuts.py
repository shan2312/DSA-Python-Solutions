The rod-cutting problem is the following. 
Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices pi for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, 
determine the maximum revenue rn obtain- able by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. 
Note that if the price pn for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.
